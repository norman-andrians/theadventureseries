At first, Westerlund was staying at his verse, inside the outerverse layer. He kept wandering from verse to verse, collecting some crystal plot fragment for killing his boredom. Sometimes he also faced the multiverse Eater, and killed it, making him called the protector by the cosmic guardian. then, after cakrawala \"transfur\" entire animalia verse, turning the entire living being in there to anthro-animal alike, Westerlund trying to coming there. At first, Westerlund was banned by saola, the president and the leader of the entire animalia verse. Saola was afraid that the outer being can make a chaos just like cakrawala and three executioner. Then, Westerlund proving himself that he was coming not to making a chaos, but just for looking for a place to stay, and some friends. He proven that by using his own limiters againts his body, reducing his own power. After that, multiverse Eater came and trying to kill animalia verse cosmic projector. Westerlund kill the multiverse Eater and since then Westerlund was accepted to coming in to animalia verse, and saola also giving him a triangle-shaped golden badge for killing the multiverse Eater.",

Westerlund then having a clash againts nagamasa, fight him for animalia verse. This was the first time that saola allowing Westerlund to using his full power, since saola well-knowingly how strong nagamasa is. After great clash, nagamasa was giving up, and leaving the animalia verse with two other executioner. Since then nagamasa and Westerlund becoming great rival. Saola giving Westerlund another badge (a round-shaped golden badge).",

Westerlund then healing the cosmic projector with his auto-defense device. Then another hypermassive star explode, but this time Westerlund succesfully nullified the explosion, saving entire animalia verse from destruction. Then saola giving another two badge for him. (A star-shaped golden badge and an diamond-shaped golden badge). Long time was passed by, Westerlund already traveled to many worlds , many verse. He was collecting many crystal plot fragment, beating the other Wanderer. This make him called the champion.",

Cakrawala finally meet with Westerlund for the first time, and he was telling the truth that Westerlund just his creation, a tool for farming some interesting stories for him. Westerlund didnt believe him, and he was angry. Then Westerlund punched cakrawala right at his face, making three executioner and some of the animalia verse residence shocked. Then Westerlund challenged cakrawala a duel. Nagamasa and saola trying to tell Westerlund that it was impossible to beat cakrawala, trying to stop Westerlund doing a suicide by challenging cakrawala. But Westerlund doesnt care. He still trying to attack cakrawala even saola was giving him order to stop. Cakrawala was giving Westerlund a warning, but once again Westerlund doesnt care. Westerlund using his maximum power, creating many magic circle, many energy, many portal, many void and many black hole to attack cakrawala. But cakrawala stopped the entire plot. Then cakrawala re-drawing the plot that making Westerlund killed by some \"mysterious cause\". Westerlund's body was burned, frozed, crushed and chopped and finally, explode, making his entire body crushed and falling to the deep void.",
